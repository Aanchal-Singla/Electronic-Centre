		<div class="accordion-content" id="contentFaq1">
			<p>An online purchase should only require credit card information, address, and phone number. If the website is also asking for your social security number, you should be suspicious. This information can be used to steal your identity and should be unnecessary for an online purchase.

			<p>
				By and large, credit cards are easily the most secure and safe payment method to use when you shop online. Credit cards use online security features like encryption and fraud monitoring to keep your accounts and personal information safe

				<p>I had been trying find an XDJ-XZ for a number of months and nearly all suppliers were constantly out of stock with an ETA of around 4-5 months.

I found Electronic Centre online and called them. They were able to check their stock allocation and advise that they were expecting a small number within 2 weeks.

				<p>I have been shopping here for over 15 years and have always received excellent customer service. So far we have had a hifi, games console and Ghd’s repaired always to what I believe a high standard as the hifi is still working 5 years later. More recently I have brought my child in to pick some sensory lighting for his room.

				<p>I had confidence in the sales assistant and so I paid online and then just last week received my unit and am very impressed with their service and 3 year warranty.

Hadn’t heard of them prior to this purchase but will def be using them again.

Fantastic local shop. As a family we try to support local. This is our go to shop for any tech needs. Staff were helpful in supplying the correct leads and advising me on how to network my house. Even spending some time on the phone with me when I ran into a few issues. Wonderful service.
